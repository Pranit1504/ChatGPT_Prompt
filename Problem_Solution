Problem : Write a ChatGPT Prompt which takes your Resume as input and parse the content in JSON format.

Solution : The ChatGPT prompt can be written as :

I need your help to turn my resume into a JSON format. I'll paste my resume below, and I'd like you to extract the information and organize it into JSON. Hereâ€™s what I need in the JSON:

- Personal Information (Name, Email, Phone, Address)
- Summary (Objective)
- Education (Degree, University, Year)
- Experience (Job Title, Company, Dates, Responsibilities)
- Skills (Technical Skills, Soft Skills)
- Projects (Title, Description, Technologies Used)
- Certifications (Name, Issuer, Date)

Here's my resume:

// Enter Resume text //

Parse this and give me the JSON output.


Note :  I have used my own resume to test the prompt. The result is given in the output.txt file in this repository.
